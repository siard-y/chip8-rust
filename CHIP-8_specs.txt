A program counter ("PC"). Points at the current instruction in memory.

One 16-bit index register ("I"). Points at locations in memory.

A stack for 16-bit addresses. Used to call subroutines/functions and return from them.

An 8-bit delay timer decrementing at a rate of 60 Hz until 0

An 8-bit sound timer. Functions like the delay timer, but beeps if not 0

16 1 byte (8 bit) general-purpose variable registers numbered 0 through F hex (0-15 in decimal). Named V0, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7, V8, V9, VA, VB, VC, VD, VE, VF
VF is also used as a flag register; many instructions will set it to either 1 or 0 based on some rule, for example using it as a carry flag
